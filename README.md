## Sudoku in Java

A bare-bones 9x9 sudoku game implemented in Java. 

As a fan of sudoku, I wanted to explore the implementation of backtracking search to verify user inputs.
In its current form, the game is borderless for the sake of simplicity 
without losing functionality with no verifying functionality.

The roadmap involves implementing difficulty logic with common sudoku techniques required to solve the puzzle.
For phase 1, the aim is to create the foundation.

*User Stories:*
- As a user, I'd like to add values to the puzzle
- As a user, I'd like to be able to remove values I've added.
- As a user, I'd like to be able to restart a game.
- As a user, I'd like to be able to quit the game.
