## Sudoku in Java

A 9x9 sudoku game implemented in Java. 

As a fan of sudoku, I wanted to explore the implementation of backtracking search to verify user inputs.
In its current form, the game is borderless for the sake of simplicity 
without losing functionality with no verifying functionality.

The roadmap involves implementing difficulty logic with common sudoku techniques required to solve the puzzle.
